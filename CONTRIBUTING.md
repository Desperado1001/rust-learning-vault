## üìù Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

1. **Clarity First**
   - Write in clear, simple language
   - Explain complex concepts step-by-step
   - Use analogies when helpful

2. **Be Concise**
   - Keep notes focused on one concept
   - Use bullet points for lists
   - Avoid unnecessary verbosity

3. **Be Accurate**
   - Verify all technical information
   - Test all code examples
   - Cite sources when needed

4. **Be Inclusive**
   - Use gender-neutral language
   - Avoid jargon without explanation
   - Consider diverse learning styles

### Note Structure

Every concept note should include:

```markdown
---
title: Concept Name
tags: [rust, topic, difficulty]
---

# Concept Name

## Overview
Brief introduction (2-3 sentences)

## Key Points
- Point 1
- Point 2
- Point 3

## Detailed Explanation
In-depth explanation with examples

## Code Example
```rust
// Practical, runnable code
fn example() {
    // ...
}
```

## Common Pitfalls
- Pitfall 1
- Pitfall 2

## Best Practices
- Practice 1
- Practice 2

## Related Concepts
- [[Related Concept 1]]
- [[Related Concept 2]]

## Resources
- [External Link 1](URL)
- [External Link 2](URL)

## Review
- Created: YYYY-MM-DD
- Last Reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
- Next Review: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Code Examples

1. **Must Be Runnable**
   ```rust
   // ‚úÖ Good - Complete, runnable example
   fn main() {
       let x = 5;
       println!("x = {}", x);
   }
   ```

2. **Include Comments**
   ```rust
   // ‚ùå Avoid - Incomplete code
   let x = 5;
   ```

3. **Show Both Good and Bad**
   ```rust
   // ‚ùå Don't do this
   let mut x = 5;
   let y = &mut x;
   let z = &mut x; // Error!
   
   // ‚úÖ Do this instead
   let mut x = 5;
   {
       let y = &mut x;
       *y += 1;
   } // y goes out of scope
   let z = &mut x; // OK!
   ```

4. **Test Your Code**
   - All code examples should compile
   - Use the Rust Playground to verify
   - Include expected output when relevant

### File Naming

- Use **kebab-case**: `async-await.md`
- Be descriptive: `error-handling-result-type.md`
- Avoid abbreviations: `ownership.md` not `own.md`
- Use `.md` extension for all notes

### Links and References

1. **Internal Links (Wikilinks)**
   ```markdown
   [[Ownership]]
   [[Borrowing|borrowing rules]]
   ```

2. **External Links**
   ```markdown
   [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
   ```

3. **Relative Links** (for images)
   ```markdown
   ![Diagram](../assets/ownership-diagram.png)
   ```

## üé® Style Guide

### Markdown Conventions

1. **Headers**
   ```markdown
   # H1 - Only for note title
   ## H2 - Major sections
   ### H3 - Subsections
   #### H4 - Sub-subsections (use sparingly)
   ```

2. **Lists**
   ```markdown
   - Unordered lists use hyphens
   - Not asterisks or plus signs
   
   1. Ordered lists use numbers
   2. Start at 1
   3. Increment by 1
   ```

3. **Code Blocks**
   ````markdown
   ```rust
   // Always specify language
   fn main() {
       println!("Hello, world!");
   }
   ```
   ````

4. **Emphasis**
   ```markdown
   **Bold** for important concepts
   *Italic* for emphasis
   `inline code` for code references
   ```

5. **Tables**
   ```markdown
   | Header 1 | Header 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
   ```

### Obsidian-Specific Features

1. **Tags**
   ```markdown
   #rust #concept #ownership #fundamental
   ```

2. **Wikilinks**
   ```markdown
   [[Ownership]]
   [[Borrowing|borrowing rules]]
   ```

3. **Callouts** (use for important notes)
   ```markdown
   > [!note]
   > This is an important note
   
   > [!warning]
   > Watch out for this common mistake
   
   > [!tip]
   > Pro tip: Use this technique
   ```
